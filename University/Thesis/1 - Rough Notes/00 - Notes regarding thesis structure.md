### Structure of Work we did:
1. Flow regimes:
	1. What are the different Flow regimes
	2. How to differentiate them.
	3. Knudsen number, Reynolds number
	4. What flow regimes will we expect using 1 bar in the chamber.
2. Isentropic 1D Flow:
	1. Why can we expect the flow to be isentropic?
	2. What does isoentropic flow indicate?
	3. Calculate the whole assembly using isentropic flow relations and using mach numbers.
	4. Calculating the cell doenst make much sense. Assume it to be reserviour.
3. Leakage:
	1. Trying to calculate it using continuum regime. Not working.
	2. Trying to use the measurements and some already existing calculations to assume expected massflow.
4. Output Velocity Distribution.
	1. Method of characteristics paper.
	2. Calculating the outside of the nozzle.
	3. Flow distribution assumption.
