# Simplifying the problem
## Simplification of the Geometry
Looking at the real geometry of the whole micro reactor it seems definitely to complicated to analyze analytically. The three main sections in the gas flow are the inlet and outlet of the reaction chamber and the reaction chamber itself.
### Inlet into the chamber
At the inlet the gas flow is leaving the nozzle and is flowing over right angles around the perimeter of the nozzle exit into a much larger section which does not resemble a duct.

It is easy to imagine that any simplification regarding the dimension of the flow as seen in ( [[Dimension of the Flow]] ) would make no sense after this point in the flow. The flow will expand freely into the much larger cavity of the chamber and the direction of the flow will change.

### The reaction chamber
Since the chamber itself is by no means symmetric, but resembles a kind of coin shape, where the flow is traveling from one side to another assuming a lower dimensional flow wont make sense without simplifying this part of the geometry.
### Outlet out of the chamber
At the outlet we will encounter a similar problem as in for the inlet. The flow will be compressed into the much smaller area of the outlet and will change direction.
### Proposed simplification
To be able to approximate this very complicated flow through the reactor by a purely one dimensional flow we are forced to transform the geometry into a series of converging and diverging ducts, where only key areas are kept the same. Namely the areas of all the nozzle inlets and outlets and the cross section at the middle of the chamber, where most probably the flow has settled into moving in one direction towards the outlet of the chamber.
Now we are left with a series of variable area ducts which can be analyzed by only considering a one dimensional flow through them.
