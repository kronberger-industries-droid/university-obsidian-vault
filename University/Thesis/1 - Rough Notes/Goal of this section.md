Trying to find exact solutions hard to impossible, even for bigger channels
friction and heat transfer plays a much greater role for micro channels since they have much more boundary area than flow area.
Always better to simulate
Simulations most of the time need boundary conditions
this analysis is not trying to provide any exact or realisic solutions but only a way to approximate values and try to help choosing the right boundary conditions and numerical tools to solve the gas flow in more detail.
