# Isentropic Flow
## Assumptions for Isentropic Flow
#### 1. Adiabatic Process
- There is no heat transfer into or out of the fluid. This means the flow is thermally insulated.

#### 2. Reversible Process
- There are no frictional effects, meaning the flow is inviscid (negligible viscosity).
- There are no shock waves or other discontinuities that would cause irreversible changes in the flow.
- There is no mixing of different fluid streams, as mixing typically increases entropy.
- There is no heat conduction within the fluid.

#### 3. Steady Flow
- The properties of the flow (pressure, density, velocity, etc.) do not change with time at any given point in the flow field.

#### 4. Homogeneous Composition
- The fluid is a single-phase gas with uniform composition, so there are no phase changes or chemical reactions.

#### 5. Negligible Body Forces
- Effects of gravitational or other body forces are either negligible or uniformly distributed.

### Mathematical Implications

Given these assumptions, the following implications hold for an isentropic flow:

#### Entropy Constant
$$
\Delta s = 0 \implies s_2 = s_1
$$
The entropy remains constant along a streamline.

#### Ideal Gas Law
The ideal gas law can be applied:
$$
PV = nRT \quad \text{or} \quad P = \rho RT
$$

#### Isentropic Relations
For an ideal gas, the following isentropic relations can be used:
$$
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}
$$
$$
\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}
$$
where $\gamma$ is the specific heat ratio $\frac{C_p}{C_v}$.

#### Bernoulli's Equation for Compressible Flow
For isentropic flow, Bernoulli's equation can be adapted to account for compressibility:
$$
\frac{V^2}{2} + \frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1} \frac{P}{\rho} = \text{constant}
$$
or in terms of total pressure and temperature:
$$
P_0 = P \left(1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2} M^2 \right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}}
$$
$$
T_0 = T \left(1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2} M^2 \right)
$$
where $P_0$ and $T_0$ are the total (stagnation) pressure and temperature, and $M$ is the Mach number.
