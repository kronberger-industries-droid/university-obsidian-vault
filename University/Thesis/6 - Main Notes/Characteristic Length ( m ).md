# Characteristic Length ( m )
#### Calculation
Usually the characteristic length scale is defined by the volume of the system divided by its surface.
$$L_c=\frac{V_{body}}{A_{surface}}$$
$V_{body} \dots$Test Volume ( m³ )
$A_{surface} \dots$Boundary of the Test Volume ( m² )
# Hydraulic Diameter

For flows through non-circular pipes (for which many types are encountered in engineering practice), the Reynolds number is redefined based on the hydraulic diameter $D_h$, i.e.,

$$
D_h = \frac{4A_c}{p}
$$

where $A_c$ is the cross-sectional area of the pipe, and $p$ is its wetted perimeter. The hydraulic diameter is sometimes called the *hydraulic mean diameter*. The basic idea is illustrated in the figure below. Naturally, the hydraulic diameter is defined to reduce to the physical diameter for circular pipes, i.e., $D_h = D$.

### Circular Duct

$$
D_h = \frac{4 (\pi D^2 / 4)}{\pi D} = D
$$
### Square Duct

$$
D_h = \frac{4a^2}{4a} = a
$$

### Rectangular Duct

$$
D_h = \frac{4ab}{2(a + b)} = \frac{2ab}{a + b}
$$
