# Sonic Regime ( Ma = 1 )

### Critical (Sonic) Conditions
Suppose we have sonic conditions at the exit plane of a duct. This will change the basic relations for [[Steady, adiabatic, isentropic flow]] and setting:

$Ma=1$
$P\rightarrow P^*$
$T\rightarrow T_0$
$\rho\rightarrow \rho^*$

and taking the reciprocal we will receive the ratio of values at the critical point over the stagnation values, now only depended on the [[Specific Heat Ratio ( 1 )]].
#### Critical Pressure Ratio
$$
\frac{P^*}{P_0}=\left(\frac{2}{\gamma+1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}}
$$
#### Critical Temperature Ratio
$$
\frac{T^*}{T_0}=\frac{2}{\gamma+1}
$$
#### Critical Temperature Ratio
$$
\frac{\rho^*}{\rho_0}=\left(\frac{2}{\gamma+1}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma-1}}
$$
#### Chocking of the flow
If the flow is chocked, no matter how much you increase the pressure difference between the outlet and the inlet of a duct, the mass flow will stay the same. 

$P_b > P\rightarrow$ the flow is **not** chocked
- $Ma_e < 1$
- $P_e = P_b$

$P_b = P\rightarrow$ the flow is **barely** chocked
- $Ma_e = 1$
- $P_e=P^*=P_b$

$P_b < P \rightarrow$ the flow is **chocked**
- $Ma_e=1$
- $P_e=P^*>P_b$

$Ma_e\dots$[[Mach number ( 1 )]] at the exit plane
$P_b\dots$back [[Pressure ( Pa )]]
$P^*\dots$[[Pressure ( Pa )]] at minimal cross section
