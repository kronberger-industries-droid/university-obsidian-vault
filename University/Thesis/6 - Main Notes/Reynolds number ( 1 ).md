# Reynolds number ( 1 )
The Reynolds number represents the ratio between inertial forces and viscous forces of a fluid or gas. It is dependent on the [[Dynamic Viscosity ( Pa s )]], Density and flow speed of the fluid, the [[Characteristic Length ( m )]] of the boundaries.
$$ Re = \frac{u \cdot L_c}{\nu} = \frac{\rho \cdot u \cdot L_c}{\mu}$$
$\rho \dots$Density of the fluid ( kg m⁻³ )
$u \dots$Flow speed ( m s⁻¹ )
$L_c \dots$[[Characteristic Length ( m )]]
$\mu \dots$[[Dynamic Viscosity ( Pa s )]]
$\nu \dots$kinematic viscosity ( m² s⁻¹ )
### Distinction between laminar and turbulent flow
This dimensionless number can be used to predict if it is probable to encounter turbulent flow or laminar flow in some region of the flow studied.
- **Laminar Flow ( $Re \le 2300$ )**
	Laminar Flow
	
- **Turbulent Flow ( $Re > 2300$ )**
	Having high Reynolds numbers means viscous forces are dominated by inertial forces. In this situation eddies and vortices begin to form.
