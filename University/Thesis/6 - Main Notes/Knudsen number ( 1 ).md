# Knudsen number ( 1 )

The Knudsen number is a dimensionless quantity used to characterize the degree of rarefaction of a gas or fluid flow. It is defined as the ratio of the mean free path of gas molecules to a characteristic length scale of the system or flow. It helps determine which [[Idealized Flow Regimes]] is applicable.
### Basic Formula
$$
Kn = \frac{\lambda}{L_c}=\frac{\pi\cdot\eta\cdot v_m}{4 p  \cdot L_c}=\frac{\pi\cdot\eta}{4 p L_c}\sqrt{\frac{8R\cdot T}{\pi\cdot M}}
$$
$\lambda\dots$[[Mean free path ( m )]]
$L \dots$[[Characteristic Length ( m )]]
