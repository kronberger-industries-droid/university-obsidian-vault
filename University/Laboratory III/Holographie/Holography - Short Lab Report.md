## 1. Experiment - Michelson Interferometer  
   - The experiment uses a Michelson interferometer to detect small changes in distance of one of the mirrors.  
   - Sensitivity to vibrations and air disturbances is crucial.  
   - Adjustments to mirrors and fine alignment are made to achieve a clear interference pattern.

## 2. Gabor Inline Hologram Experiment  
   - A simple transmission holography method using a transparent object.  
   - The object scatters light, creating an interference pattern with the reference beam.  
   - The hologram is recorded, developed, and then carefully analyzed.  
   - **Exposure time:** 5 seconds  
   - **Result:** The hologram was good and the imaged object was recognizable after development.

## 3. Denisyuk/White Light Hologram Experiment  
   - A reflection holography method that allows viewing under white light.  
   - Light is reflected from the object and interferes with the reference beam.  
   - Requires stable positioning and careful development to maintain holographic integrity.  
   - **Exposure time:** 4 seconds  
   - **Result:** The hologram was good and the imaged object was recognizable after development.

## 4. Laser Transmission Hologram Experiment  
   - Uses a two-beam setup to create a bright, high-quality transmission hologram.  
   - Mirrors adjust the reference beam while the object is positioned carefully.  
   - Laser stability and controlled exposure time are critical to success.  
   - **Exposure time:** 5 seconds  
   - **Result:** The hologram was good and the imaged object was recognizable after development.
