 - Paradigm shift
 - The move from logic and algorithmic certainty to probability and LLMs as story machines.

Large language models as bullshitters.

20th century Ai has a more logical approach, instead now very different.

Discontinuous changes around the paradigm.

## How did Ai and Computer sciences center on "algorithmic certainty?" (main part!)

### Dartmouth Summer research project:
 - Proposal funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.
 - Founders of artificial inteligence.
 - How is ai concieved:
 - Paper: "A proposal for the dartmouth summer research project on Ai."

### Institutionalizing Ai:
 - MIT -> Stanford Ai lab. Are outlierers, since they much more funding from military and connection to cold war.
 - DOD ARPA and funding increases -> first CS graduate 1968.
 - CS and Ai coming into existing at the same time.
 - People who did cs where more logical thinking people.

## Agenda of the 1960-1980s:
### Ai
 - Search and knowledge representation.
 - It was thought that solving things like playing chest, would correlate to things like cognition.
  - Search
  - Heuristics
  - Rewriting of Symbols
  - Structured knowledge representation
  - Emphasis on implementation over theory
### Cs
 - People maintaining and building computers for science purposes started to get interested in the workings behind computers -> Computer science department.
	- But this needs body of theory:
	- Electronic engineering
	- Numerical analysis
	- Discrete Mathematics
	- Information theory
	- programming languages & compilers
 - All are part of other fields, therefore early on "Ai" would be seen as a specific field only for Cs.
 - Tears of Donald Knuth
 - Winners of the first Turing awards, where 4/11 where Ai.
 - Conceive computer sciences as a usually federated discipline (therefore no strict paradigme)
 - But theoretical Computer science 1975 - 1994, was the majority of.
 - "Mike Mahoney" Book over assembling computer sciences, migration of computerscientist, from other established disciplines.
